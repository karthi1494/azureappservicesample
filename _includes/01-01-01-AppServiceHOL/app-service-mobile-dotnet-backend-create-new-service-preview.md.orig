   > As part of this tutorial, you create a new SQL Database instance and server. You can reuse this new database and administer it as you would any other SQL Database instance. If you already have a database in the same region as the new mobile app backend, you can instead choose **Use existing Database** and then select that database. The use of a database in a different region is not recommended because of additional bandwidth costs and higher latencies.

3. Select your subscription.

4. Create a new resource group with the same name as your mobile app.

5. In **Package Settings**, select **USERDATABASE**, you can choose an existing database or create a new one. For creating a new database, type the name of the new **database**, create a new **server**, type the name of that server, then choose a **login name**, which is the administrator login name for the new SQL Database server, type and confirm the password, and click the ok button to complete the process. If selecting an existing database, you will need to provide a **Server Administrator Password**.

6. Create a new App Service Plan with the same name as your mobile app.

   > Type your App Service Plan name, do not copy/paste. There is name validation on this field that fails if you don't type the name. It doesn't have to be exactly the same name as the website (but it needs to follow the same rules).

8. Select a Pricing Tier.

   Your new mobile app settings page will now look something like this:

9. Click the **Create** button at the bottom of the blade and you should see it starting deployment in the notifications window.

You have now created a new mobile app backend that can be used by your mobile apps.

> After your mobile app is created, navigate in the portal to the sql server you just created (be sure to select the server and not the azure sql db). From there, click the settings part, expand the firewall part, and change the "Allow access to Azure services". If you don't do this, your application won't work.

##Mobile backend verification steps
In the portal, you should now see the newly created Mobile App. You can either browse for all your Mobile Apps, by selecting clicking the **BROWSE** button on the portal left nav-bar. Or if you have made no changes to the defaults during creation, you should see your new Mobile App on your start board. 

10. select the mobile backend app you created. The blad that opens displays your Mobile App URL.

11. Click on the Mobile App URL to open an new tab in your browser displaying the mobile app you just created. The page you are seeing is the default created view web apps. You can change it later if you wish to.

12. Click on the **try it out** arrow on the bottom left part of the mobile backend. This will prompt you for username and password. You will need to copy the Master Key from the **Keys** part on the mobile app blade in the portal. Leave the username empty and just use the Master Key.
