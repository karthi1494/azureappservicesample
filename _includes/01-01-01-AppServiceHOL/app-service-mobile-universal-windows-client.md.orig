Once you have created your mobile app backend, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Azure Portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile app backend.

In this section you will create a new universal Windows app that is connected to your mobile app backend.

1. In the Azure Portal, click **Mobile App**, and then click the mobile app that you just created.

2. At the top of the blade, click **Add Client** and expand **Windows (C#)**.

   This displays the three easy steps to create a Windows Store app connected to your mobile app backend.

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546" target="_blank">Visual Studio Professional 2013</a> on your local computer or virtual machine.

4. Under **Download and run your app and service locally**, select a language for your Windows Store app, then click **Download**.

5. The mobile client application for Windows includes three projects. One projected *shared* by the two other Windows Phone and Windows 8.1 projects. the *shared* project includes, among other, the DataModel folder. Identify the **TodoItem.cs** file and add two properties as indicated by the following code snippet:

    public class TodoItem
    {
    public string Id { get; set; }
    
    [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "text")]
    public string Text { get; set; }
    
    [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "complete")]
    public bool Complete { get; set; }
    
    [JsonProperty(PropertyName ="phonenumber")]
    public string PhoneNumber { get; set; }
    }

6. Next you need to edit **MainPage.xaml** in the Windows 8.1 project. You need to add a new textbox for the phone number and a corresponding label. Locate the TextInput TextBox and then make the edits to match the following code snippet 

    StackPanel Orientation="Vertical" Margin="72,0,0,0">

    	TextBlock>free text goes here</TextBlock>
    	<TextBox Name="TextInput" Margin="5" MinWidth="300"></TextBox>
    	<TextBlock>phone number goes here</TextBlock>
    	<TextBox Name="PhoneInput" Margin="5" MinWidth="300"></TextBox>	
    	<Button Name="ButtonSave" Click="ButtonSave_Click" IsEnabled="False">Save</Button>
    </StackPanel>

7. At this stage your Windows 8.1 application should be ready to run and successfully connect to your mobile backend
